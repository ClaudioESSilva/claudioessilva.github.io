As a Windows user I know there are lots of shortcuts and small hacks, that I love, which make my life much easier! Here is my small contribution:
Windows tips &amp;amp; tricks and shortcuts WIN + X -&amp;gt; to access a lot of management stuff in a quick way WIN + V -&amp;gt; If you looking for a clipboard manager (keep multiple entries) since Windows 10 (build 1809) we can have it natively.</description></item><item><title>Don't cutoff yourself with dates in T-SQL - Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/09/04/Dont-cutoff-yourself-with-dates-in-T-SQL-Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/09/04/Dont-cutoff-yourself-with-dates-in-T-SQL-Did-you-know.../</guid><description>Almost all the applications we use have a lot of options. And, sometimes we even stumble across them by accident. Who&amp;rsquo;s ever heard something like &amp;ldquo;Normal user don&amp;rsquo;t even use 5% of Excel capabilities!&amp;rdquo;?
Other options, we know they exist but because the default value it’s ok (so far) we tend to forget it. It is just sitting there, waiting for the day we want/need to change it.
The oddity Few days ago I was talking with a friend that show me some &amp;ldquo;odd behavior&amp;rdquo; when working with dates on SQL Server.</description></item><item><title>Did you know...you can change the default file encoding for new query on SSMS?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/06/05/Did-you-know...you-can-change-the-default-file-encoding-for-new-query-on-SSMS/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/06/05/Did-you-know...you-can-change-the-default-file-encoding-for-new-query-on-SSMS/</guid><description>If you have been reading my last blog posts, you know that I’m currently working on a SQL code migration from Firebird to SQL Server.
The client provided the scripts with all modules (Stored Procedures, functions, etc) and the steps I&amp;rsquo;m following (roughly speaking) for converting are:
Open new query window Copy and paste de object code Save the file This is how the file look like: Run a PowerShell script that does a find and replace based on a hashtable.</description></item><item><title>Using CAST() function with User-Defined Data Types...Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/05/02/Using-CAST-function-with-User-Defined-Data-Types...Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/05/02/Using-CAST-function-with-User-Defined-Data-Types...Did-you-know.../</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m converting some Firebird database code to T-SQL and I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a lot of code that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in the same way that SQL Server. No surprise - I already expected that but for those that still say that &amp;ldquo;all engines/databases are equal&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;is SQL right?&amp;rdquo; here is another proof that is not true.
On Firebird it is possible to use the CAST function using a DOMAIN (the equivalent in SQLServer is UDDT - User-Defined Data Types ) as target data-type, well turns out that on SQL Server&amp;hellip;that is not possible.</description></item><item><title>Did you know…you can’t do arithmetic operations with datetime2 like with datetime?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/06/Did-you-knowyou-cant-do-arithmetic-operations-with-datetime2-like-with-datetime/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/06/Did-you-knowyou-cant-do-arithmetic-operations-with-datetime2-like-with-datetime/</guid><description>I’m currently working on a SQL code migration from Firebird to SQL Server and I hit an error that I haven’t seen for some time.
The error message is the following:
Msg 206, Level 16, State 2, Line 4 Operand type clash: datetime2 is incompatible with int
This ringed the bell right away! Somewhere on the code someone was trying to do an arithmetic calculation without using the proper function.</description></item><item><title>Using Common Table Expression (CTE) - Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/11/30/Using-Common-Table-Expression-CTE-Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/11/30/Using-Common-Table-Expression-CTE-Did-you-know.../</guid><description>Today I will write just a short blog post to do a quick reminder!
I still hear a lot of people suggesting CTEs because they think it works like a temporary table (you populate the table and then it can be/is reutilized).
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t!
From de documentation :
Specifies a temporary named result set, known as a common table expression (CTE).
Maybe they are focusing on the &amp;ldquo;temporary&amp;rdquo; word.
Using the CTE two times will perform two different executions!</description></item><item><title>DELETE data on SQL Server HEAP table - Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/26/DELETE-data-on-SQL-Server-HEAP-table-Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/26/DELETE-data-on-SQL-Server-HEAP-table-Did-you-know.../</guid><description>Before I complete my question let me provide context.
I&amp;rsquo;ve received an alert saying that a specific database could not allocate a new page (disk was full)
The message that you will see on the SQL Server Error log is:
Could not allocate a new page for database &amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; because of insufficient disk space in filegroup &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;. Create the necessary space by dropping objects in the filegroup, adding additional files to the filegroup, or setting autogrowth on for existing files in the filegroup.</description></item></channel></rss>
