It was interesting some comments I read about it, mainly why people still use &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> when it&amp;rsquo;s simple to overcome this when we have the right permissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Server offers an option to encrypt the code of your modules when using the &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> syntax.
This allows to hide/obfuscate the modules&amp;rsquo; code and thus keep away from prying eyes.
It&amp;rsquo;s often used to protect business rules since it allows you to protect some intellectual property.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Generate SQL Server Role Member Reports using dbatools and ImportExcel PowerShell modules</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/07/31/Generate-SQL-Server-Role-Member-Reports-using-dbatools-and-ImportExcel-PowerShell-modules/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/07/31/Generate-SQL-Server-Role-Member-Reports-using-dbatools-and-ImportExcel-PowerShell-modules/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>

&lt;p>These reports are especially useful when performing tech-refreshes (migrating from an old version to a newer one) and you want to do some housekeeping. For example, finding logins that should be part of a role and they are not. Once you know there are problems, you decided to do a double-check on the whole list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backup your SQL instances configurations to GIT with dbatools - Part 2 - Add parallelism</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/04/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-2-Add-parallelism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/04/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-2-Add-parallelism/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have seen how we can export and save the results to a folder and commit them to a GIT repository on my last blog post &lt;a href="https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/02/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-1/"

&lt;p>When we need to manage dozens of servers/instances, even with automated scripts sometimes we would like that our script finishes faster.
There are multiple reasons that a sequential (one-by-one) run takes longer.

&lt;li>You need a GIT repository&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GIT tools installed on the server where you are running the script so you can commit your changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dbatools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A list or a place to get all instances that you want to run the export&lt;/li>

 Refresh databases that belongs to availability group using dbatools

 posted a few days ago, today I will share a way to export the permissions of a login/user at instance/database level and apply them to a new login/user.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-typical-request">The typical request&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Client: &amp;ldquo;We have a new colleague, can you please grant them the exact same permissions I have?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick note/suggestion that may help minimize your work: If we are talking about a Windows Login, please suggest the use of AD groups to help you (so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this process) and also them (they don&amp;rsquo;t need to make this request).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Export Deadlocks to file from system_health Extended Event using PowerShell</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/25/Export-Deadlocks-to-file-from-system_health-Extended-Event-using-PowerShell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/25/Export-Deadlocks-to-file-from-system_health-Extended-Event-using-PowerShell/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a quick post as may help any of you searching for this.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-do-we-get-the-deadlocks">How do we get the deadlocks?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Depending on the version of SQL Server that you are running, there are different ways to do it.
In this post I will share how you can do it from all files that belongs to the &lt;code>system_health&lt;/code> extended event session. (Not only the current file).
This works on SQL Server 2012 or higher version.

You just need to right click on the object (well&amp;hellip;not on every single one, try it with an Availability Group :-), no script option available) select &amp;ldquo;Script XXXX as&amp;rdquo; and you have it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But have you realized that this option doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring all the stuff?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are scripting a table and you have a Non-Clustered index or a trigger&amp;hellip;using this option some of the objects under the table will not be scripted out. I understand this as each one of this is a different object, which means if you go to each one you can right click and script just that one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leveraging on SQL Server metadata</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/08/24/Leveraging-on-SQL-Server-metadata/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/08/24/Leveraging-on-SQL-Server-metadata/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m working on a project where I need to convert Firebird SQL code into T-SQL code.
