&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t think so! That&amp;rsquo;s why we, within dbatools project, try to keep the output of the exceptions more user friendly and try to give the direct error message to you.

It was interesting some comments I read about it, mainly why people still use &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> when it&amp;rsquo;s simple to overcome this when we have the right permissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Server offers an option to encrypt the code of your modules when using the &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> syntax.
This allows to hide/obfuscate the modules&amp;rsquo; code and thus keep away from prying eyes.
It&amp;rsquo;s often used to protect business rules since it allows you to protect some intellectual property.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When one of your DBA colleagues leaves the company, what is your checklist?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whether it’s in our personal lives or the professional one, we do have checklists for certain tasks.&lt;/p>

No schema, just the modules. There are more than 1000 objects between stored procedures, views, triggers, user-defined data types, etc.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have heard about SQL Server the first time back in 2003 when I was on the high school and I had a database class.

&lt;p>A non-parallel execution (single session) took more than 2 hours.

 dbachecks
&lt;/a>
 has seen the light about two months ago. As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post, the module counts with more than 2600 downloads just from the &lt;a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/dbachecks"

 
 target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

 PowerShell gallery
&lt;/a>
.
The module has about 110 configurable checks that make our live easier!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I will write about an option that I think users still do not realize that exists.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-default">The default&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>dbachecks works with the values previously saved (for that we use &lt;code>Set-DbcConfig&lt;/code>). This means that when we start a new session and the last session has changed any configuration, that configuration is now, by default, the one that will be used in the new session.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Is this command broken?

&lt;p>For instance, someone was using the Get-Service command to query what was the &amp;ldquo;Startup Type&amp;rdquo; of &lt;a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/jonjor/2009/01/09/winrm-windows-remote-management-troubleshooting/"

&lt;p>This stored procedure works on any version/edition since SQL Server 2005 SP1.
