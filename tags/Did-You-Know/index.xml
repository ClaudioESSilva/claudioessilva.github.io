And, sometimes we even stumble across them by accident.
Who&amp;rsquo;s ever heard something like &amp;ldquo;Normal user don&amp;rsquo;t even use 5% of Excel capabilities!&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other options, we know they exist but because the default value it’s ok (so far) we tend to forget it. It is just sitting there, waiting for the day we want/need to change it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-oddity">The oddity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Few days ago I was talking with a friend that show me some &amp;ldquo;odd behavior&amp;rdquo; when working with dates on SQL Server.

&lt;p>The client provided the scripts with all modules (Stored Procedures, functions, etc) and the steps I&amp;rsquo;m following (roughly speaking) for converting are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Open new query window&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy and paste de object code&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Save the file
This is how the file look like:
&lt;img src="https://claudioessilva.eu/img/2018/06/savedwithdefaultencoding_ansi1.png" alt="savedwithdefaultencoding_ansi1">&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run a PowerShell script that does a find and replace based on a hashtable. Apply all the changes and save the file again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The file refresh on SSMS
This is how the file look like after the find and replace:
&lt;img src="https://claudioessilva.eu/img/2018/06/afterfindreplacepowershellandsaveasutf81.png" alt="afterfindreplacepowershellandsaveasutf81">&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unicode characters are broken :-(&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="sowhat-is-happening">So&amp;hellip;what is happening?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The file that is used to create a new query window has ANSI encoding but when I save the file on the PowerShell script I save it as UTF-8 because the client have comments on the code with unicode characters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Did you know…you can’t do arithmetic operations with datetime2 like with datetime?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/06/Did-you-knowyou-cant-do-arithmetic-operations-with-datetime2-like-with-datetime/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/06/Did-you-knowyou-cant-do-arithmetic-operations-with-datetime2-like-with-datetime/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’m currently working on a SQL code migration from &lt;a href="https://firebirdsql.org/"

 Firebird
&lt;/a>
 to SQL Server and I hit an error that I haven’t seen for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The error message is the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Msg 206, Level 16, State 2, Line 4
Operand type clash: datetime2 is incompatible with int&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This ringed the bell right away! Somewhere on the code someone was trying to do an arithmetic calculation without using the proper function.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
