 Identify Tables With Dropped Columns
&lt;/a>
 - we saw how we can identify tables that have columns that were dropped. &lt;br>
Today, we are going to check a way to approximately calculate how much space we can expect to recover if we rebuild our table.&lt;/p>

 What happens when we drop a column on a SQL Server table? Where&amp;rsquo;s my space?
&lt;/a>
 - I have shown what happens when we drop a column from a table.&lt;br>
Today, we are going to check if we have a way to find tables with dropped columns.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we learnt, when we drop a column this is just a metadata operation and won’t clear the space that was being used. You may be asking - Do I have more tables with dropped columns that I’m not aware of? - And that is a legit question.&lt;br>
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how we can achieve this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What happens when we drop a column on a SQL Server table?

&lt;p>Short answer: The column is marked as &amp;lsquo;deleted&amp;rsquo; and will stop being visible/usable.&lt;br>
But, most importantly - &lt;strong>The record/table size will remain unchanged&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="a-metadata-operation">A metadata operation&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Dropping a column is a metadata/logical operation, not a physical one. This means that the data isn&amp;rsquo;t removed/overwritten by this action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we were talking about deleting data (records), as Paul Randal mentions &lt;a href="https://www.sqlskills.com/blogs/paul/inside-the-storage-engine-anatomy-of-a-page/"

 @ 2020-08-18.
It was interesting some comments I read about it, mainly why people still use &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> when it&amp;rsquo;s simple to overcome this when we have the right permissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Server offers an option to encrypt the code of your modules when using the &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> syntax.
This allows to hide/obfuscate the modules&amp;rsquo; code and thus keep away from prying eyes.
It&amp;rsquo;s often used to protect business rules since it allows you to protect some intellectual property.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When one of your DBA colleagues leaves the company, what is your checklist?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whether it’s in our personal lives or the professional one, we do have checklists for certain tasks.&lt;/p>

The next possible way is to make the login as the owner of the job and it needs to belong to one of the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/sql-server-agent-fixed-database-roles?view=sql-server-2017"

&lt;p>But have you realized that this option doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring all the stuff?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are scripting a table and you have a Non-Clustered index or a trigger&amp;hellip;using this option some of the objects under the table will not be scripted out. I understand this as each one of this is a different object, which means if you go to each one you can right click and script just that one.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Access is denied - Using DTCPing utility between two Windows Server 2016</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/10/Access-is-denied-Using-DTCPing-utility-between-two-Windows-Server-2016/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/10/Access-is-denied-Using-DTCPing-utility-between-two-Windows-Server-2016/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://claudioessilva.eu/img/2019/05/featureimage_smaller-1.png" alt="featureimage_smaller">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have heard about SQL Server the first time back in 2003 when I was on the high school and I had a database class. Was a slow start and, at that moment I haven&amp;rsquo;t imagined that would follow that path professionally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using CAST() function with User-Defined Data Types...Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/05/02/Using-CAST-function-with-User-Defined-Data-Types...Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/05/02/Using-CAST-function-with-User-Defined-Data-Types...Did-you-know.../</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m converting some &lt;a href="https://www.firebirdsql.org"

No surprise - I already expected that but for those that still say that &amp;ldquo;all engines/databases are equal&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;is SQL right?&amp;rdquo; here is another proof that is not true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Firebird it is possible to use the CAST function using a &lt;a href="https://firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/reference_manuals/fblangref25-en/html/fblangref25-ddl-domn.html"

The module has about 110 configurable checks that make our live easier!&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="the-default">The default&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>dbachecks works with the values previously saved (for that we use &lt;code>Set-DbcConfig&lt;/code>).
