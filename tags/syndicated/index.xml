I have to say that I just have played a handful of times with FTS, mostly in a didactic way, and not so much in the perspective of a production system and its maintenance.
Long story short, this client had a couple of problems in the past with FTS.</description></item><item><title>Recover database encrypted modules code with dbatools</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/22/Recover-database-encrypted-modules-code-with-dbatools/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/22/Recover-database-encrypted-modules-code-with-dbatools/</guid><description>This article was initially posted on SQLServerCentral @ 2020-08-18. It was interesting some comments I read about it, mainly why people still use WITH ENCRYPTION when it&amp;rsquo;s simple to overcome this when we have the right permissions.
SQL Server offers an option to encrypt the code of your modules when using the WITH ENCRYPTION syntax. This allows to hide/obfuscate the modules&amp;rsquo; code and thus keep away from prying eyes. It&amp;rsquo;s often used to protect business rules since it allows you to protect some intellectual property.</description></item><item><title>When one of your DBA colleagues leaves the company, what is your checklist?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</guid><description>Whether it’s in our personal lives or the professional one, we do have checklists for certain tasks.

A quick note/suggestion that may help minimize your work: If we are talking about a Windows Login, please suggest the use of AD groups to help you (so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this process) and also them (they don&amp;rsquo;t need to make this request).</description></item><item><title>Export Deadlocks to file from system_health Extended Event using PowerShell</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/25/Export-Deadlocks-to-file-from-system_health-Extended-Event-using-PowerShell/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/25/Export-Deadlocks-to-file-from-system_health-Extended-Event-using-PowerShell/</guid><description>Just a quick post as may help any of you searching for this.

&amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back for a moment:&amp;rdquo; I have heard about SQL Server the first time back in 2003 when I was on the high school and I had a database class.</description></item><item><title>Using CAST() function with User-Defined Data Types...Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/05/02/Using-CAST-function-with-User-Defined-Data-Types...Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/05/02/Using-CAST-function-with-User-Defined-Data-Types...Did-you-know.../</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m converting some Firebird database code to T-SQL and I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a lot of code that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in the same way that SQL Server. No surprise - I already expected that but for those that still say that &amp;ldquo;all engines/databases are equal&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;is SQL right?&amp;rdquo; here is another proof that is not true.
On Firebird it is possible to use the CAST function using a DOMAIN (the equivalent in SQLServer is UDDT - User-Defined Data Types) as target data-type, well turns out that on SQL Server&amp;hellip;that is not possible.</description></item><item><title>dbachecks - Going parallel - Cut off your execution times</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/26/dbachecks-Going-parallel-Cut-off-your-execution-times/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/26/dbachecks-Going-parallel-Cut-off-your-execution-times/</guid><description>On one of the last clients I have worked, I have implemented dbachecks in order to get the state of art and know how cool or bad the environments are before start knocking down the bad practices.
This client has seven different environments with more than 100 instances and more than 2000 databases.
Serial execution A non-parallel execution (single session) took more than 2 hours. This is not a big problem when we run it out of hours and we don&amp;rsquo;t want/need to be looking or waiting for it to finish.</description></item><item><title>dbachecks - Setting temporary configuration values</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/24/dbachecks-Setting-temporary-configuration-values/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/24/dbachecks-Setting-temporary-configuration-values/</guid><description>dbachecks has seen the light about two months ago. As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog post, the module counts with more than 2600 downloads just from the PowerShell gallery. The module has about 110 configurable checks that make our live easier!
Today I will write about an option that I think users still do not realize that exists.
The default dbachecks works with the values previously saved (for that we use Set-DbcConfig).</description></item><item><title>Did you know…you can’t do arithmetic operations with datetime2 like with datetime?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/06/Did-you-knowyou-cant-do-arithmetic-operations-with-datetime2-like-with-datetime/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/06/Did-you-knowyou-cant-do-arithmetic-operations-with-datetime2-like-with-datetime/</guid><description>I’m currently working on a SQL code migration from Firebird to SQL Server and I hit an error that I haven’t seen for some time.
The error message is the following:

This ringed the bell right away!

Recently, dbatools added a new command that turns this validation a piece of cake. Thanks to Simone Bizzotto (@niphlod) for baking up the command that Shawn Melton (@wsmelton) and I initially requested.
Some dbatools users already expressed their happiness with the command, like Jess Pomfret did here</description></item><item><title>New version of sp_WhoIsActive (v11.20) is available - Deployed on 123 instances in less than 1 minute</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/12/05/New-version-of-sp_WhoIsActive-v11.20-is-available-Deployed-on-123-instances-in-less-than-1-minute/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/12/05/New-version-of-sp_WhoIsActive-v11.20-is-available-Deployed-on-123-instances-in-less-than-1-minute/</guid><description>Last night, I received Adam Machanic&amp;rsquo;s (b | t) newsletter &amp;ldquo;Announcing sp_whoisactive v11.20: Live Query Plans&amp;rdquo;.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know about it, sp_WhoIsActive is a stored procedure that provides detailed information about the sessions running on your SQL Server instance. It is a great tool when we need to troubleshoot some problems such as long-running queries or blocking. (just two examples)
This stored procedure works on any version/edition since SQL Server 2005 SP1.</description></item><item><title>Using Common Table Expression (CTE) - Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/11/30/Using-Common-Table-Expression-CTE-Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/11/30/Using-Common-Table-Expression-CTE-Did-you-know.../</guid><description>Today I will write just a short blog post to do a quick reminder!
I still hear a lot of people suggesting CTEs because they think it works like a temporary table (you populate the table and then it can be/is reutilized).
It doesn&amp;rsquo;t!
From de documentation:
Specifies a temporary named result set, known as a common table expression (CTE).
Maybe they are focusing on the &amp;ldquo;temporary&amp;rdquo; word.
Using the CTE two times will perform two different executions!</description></item><item><title>DELETE data on SQL Server HEAP table - Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/26/DELETE-data-on-SQL-Server-HEAP-table-Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/26/DELETE-data-on-SQL-Server-HEAP-table-Did-you-know.../</guid><description>Before I complete my question let me provide context.
I&amp;rsquo;ve received an alert saying that a specific database could not allocate a new page (disk was full)
The message that you will see on the SQL Server Error log is:
Could not allocate a new page for database &amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; because of insufficient disk space in filegroup &amp;lsquo;&amp;rsquo;. Create the necessary space by dropping objects in the filegroup, adding additional files to the filegroup, or setting autogrowth on for existing files in the filegroup.</description></item><item><title>Someone is not following the best practices - dbatools and Pester don't lie!</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/12/Someone-is-not-following-the-best-practices-dbatools-and-Pester-dont-lie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/12/Someone-is-not-following-the-best-practices-dbatools-and-Pester-dont-lie/</guid><description>This month’s T-SQL Tuesday is brought to us by my good friend Rob Sewell (b | t).

Today I bring another quick tip on Microsoft Documentation!
Download Microsoft Documentation Did you know that we can download PDF files with Microsoft Documentation? I did not know until my colleague called my attention to it few days ago.
Important note: This tip is not (yet?) available for all Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s product suite. You should confirm if this tip applies to the product you need.</description></item><item><title>Contribute to Microsoft Documentation</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/08/28/Contribute-to-Microsoft-Documentation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/08/28/Contribute-to-Microsoft-Documentation/</guid><description>Times have changed and Microsoft has changed the way we can contribute for documentation!
We already have access to the source code from some programs. One example is PowerShell, that has an GitHub repository where anyone can contribute!
Now anyone can contribute to the documentation too!
How and where? If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before, now we have a pencil icon on the top right corner that makes possible to suggest a change.</description></item></channel></rss>
