I immediately thought about dbatools for the job!
NOTE: I also thought about SSMS &amp;ldquo;Import/Export Data&amp;rdquo;. And this is ok when someone says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s to run just once, just now&amp;rdquo;. When you are in the IT for a while you know that is not only once :-). And what if I need to re-run?</description></item></channel></rss>
