.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I want to share something, Query Store related, that bugged me for awhile and a workaround to overcome it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>NOTE:&lt;/strong> This happens at least until SSMS v19.3 (most recent version of SSMS at the time of this writing). Let’s see what newer versions bring us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="multiple-instances-of-the-same-dashboard">Multiple instances of the same dashboard&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m talking about using the Query Store GUI to search for some portion of text used in a T-SQL query and, with that, find a query that you want to analyze within it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
