A quick note/suggestion that may help minimize your work: If we are talking about a Windows Login, please suggest the use of AD groups to help you (so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this process) and also them (they don&amp;rsquo;t need to make this request).</description></item></channel></rss>
