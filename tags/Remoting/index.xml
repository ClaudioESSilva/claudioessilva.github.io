Which commands? Commands like Get-DbaComputerCertificate, Get-DbaPrivilege, Get-DbaClientAlias, just to mention a few of them, make use of the internal function Invoke-Command2 which uses New-PSSession when we run it against a remote computer.

Today, the module has more than 260 commands. Go get it and try it!</description></item><item><title>HTTP 403 error - PowerShell Remoting, Different Domains and Proxies</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/04/HTTP-403-error-PowerShell-Remoting-Different-Domains-and-Proxies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/04/HTTP-403-error-PowerShell-Remoting-Different-Domains-and-Proxies/</guid><description>On my day to day work I use Nagios monitoring software. I want to add some custom SQL Server scripts to enrich the monitoring, and to accomplish this I will need to:
Find a folder Create a sub folder Copy bunch of file edit a ini file to verify/add new entries all of this for every single host on my entire estate. Obviously (for me :-) ) I decided to use PowerShell!</description></item></channel></rss>
