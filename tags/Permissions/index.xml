&lt;p>On the professional level, it can be purely technical like SQL Server installation, configuration or even uninstall, but they can also be not so technical like when a colleague join the team and someone needs to request permissions to access the company&amp;rsquo;s tools (such as ticketing/incidents/VPN/etc).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As one of dbatools&amp;rsquo; first members, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for years and it&amp;rsquo;s really my goto tool. This task was no different!&lt;/p>

 is about generating an Excel workbook that contains lists of SQL Server roles and its members.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-usefulness-of-these-reports">The Usefulness of these Reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These reports are especially useful when performing tech-refreshes (migrating from an old version to a newer one) and you want to do some housekeeping. For example, finding logins that should be part of a role and they are not. Once you know there are problems, you decided to do a double-check on the whole list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replicate permissions to new Login/User with dbatools</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/28/Replicate-permissions-to-new-Login/User-with-dbatools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/28/Replicate-permissions-to-new-Login/User-with-dbatools/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing to share tips and tricks using &lt;a href="https://dbatools.io"

&lt;p>Client: &amp;ldquo;We have a new colleague, can you please grant them the exact same permissions I have?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick note/suggestion that may help minimize your work: If we are talking about a Windows Login, please suggest the use of AD groups to help you (so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this process) and also them (they don&amp;rsquo;t need to make this request).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
