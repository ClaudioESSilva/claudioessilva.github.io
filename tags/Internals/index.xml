Where&amp;rsquo;s my space? - I have shown what happens when we drop a column from a table.
Today, we are going to check if we have a way to find tables with dropped columns.
Why? As we learnt, when we drop a column this is just a metadata operation and won’t clear the space that was being used.</description></item><item><title>What happens when we drop a column on a SQL Server table?

Short answer: The column is marked as &amp;lsquo;deleted&amp;rsquo; and will stop being visible/usable.
But, most importantly - The record/table size will remain unchanged.
A metadata operation Dropping a column is a metadata/logical operation, not a physical one. This means that the data isn&amp;rsquo;t removed/overwritten by this action. As Paul Randal mentions here :
&amp;ldquo;the cost of that will be deferred for the inserters and not for the deleters&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
