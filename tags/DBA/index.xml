Short answer: The column is marked as &amp;lsquo;deleted&amp;rsquo; and will stop being visible/usable.
But, most importantly - The record/table size will remain unchanged.
A metadata operation Dropping a column is a metadata/logical operation, not a physical one. This means that the data isn&amp;rsquo;t removed/overwritten by this action. As Paul Randal mentions here :
&amp;ldquo;the cost of that will be deferred for the inserters and not for the deleters&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Check Azure SQL DB Space Used</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2024/05/02/Check-Azure-SQL-DB-Space-Used/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 11:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2024/05/02/Check-Azure-SQL-DB-Space-Used/</guid><description>A couple of days ago I was doing some cleaning on some Azure SQL DBs and shrinking some files to lower the bill.
To check my progress I needed to check the size before/after the task in an easy way for multiple Azure SQL DBs.
