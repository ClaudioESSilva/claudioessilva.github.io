&lt;p>At PowerShell community we often call it a &amp;ldquo;sea of red&amp;rdquo; which we found as something that can be intimidating. The bigger the error message the more problematic it is? :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t think so! That&amp;rsquo;s why we, within dbatools project, try to keep the output of the exceptions more user friendly and try to give the direct error message to you.

It was interesting some comments I read about it, mainly why people still use &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> when it&amp;rsquo;s simple to overcome this when we have the right permissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SQL Server offers an option to encrypt the code of your modules when using the &lt;code>WITH ENCRYPTION&lt;/code> syntax.
This allows to hide/obfuscate the modules&amp;rsquo; code and thus keep away from prying eyes.
It&amp;rsquo;s often used to protect business rules since it allows you to protect some intellectual property.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When one of your DBA colleagues leaves the company, what is your checklist?</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/09/03/When-one-of-your-DBA-colleagues-leaves-the-company-what-is-your-checklist/</guid><description>&lt;p>Whether it’s in our personal lives or the professional one, we do have checklists for certain tasks.&lt;/p>

 sp_WhoIsActive
&lt;/a>
 is a stored procedure that provides detailed information about the sessions running on your SQL Server instance.
It is a great tool when we need to troubleshoot some problems such as long-running queries or blocking. (&lt;strong>just&lt;/strong> two examples)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This stored procedure works on any version/edition since SQL Server 2005 SP1. Although, you only will be able to see the new feature (live query plans) if you run it on SQL Server 2016 or 2017.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Someone is not following the best practices - dbatools and Pester don't lie!</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/12/Someone-is-not-following-the-best-practices-dbatools-and-Pester-dont-lie/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/12/Someone-is-not-following-the-best-practices-dbatools-and-Pester-dont-lie/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://sqldbawithabeard.com/2017/09/05/tsql2sday-94-lets-get-all-posh/"

For those who don’t know, dbatools is a module, written by the community, that makes SQL Server administration much easier using PowerShell. Today, the module has more than 260 commands.
