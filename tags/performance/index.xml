Scenario Client wants to analyze most recent deadlocks that happened on a specific instance. They asked us to send the xdl files.
How do we get the deadlocks? Depending on the version of SQL Server that you are running, there are different ways to do it. In this post I will share how you can do it from all files that belongs to the system_health extended event session.</description></item><item><title>T-SQL Copy &amp; Paste Pattern - Increasing a performance problem</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/02/21/T-SQL-Copy-Paste-Pattern-Increasing-a-performance-problem/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/02/21/T-SQL-Copy-Paste-Pattern-Increasing-a-performance-problem/</guid><description>Disclaimer: The title is my assumption because I saw it in the past happening this way.
This blog post aims to make you remember something: something that is obvious to you, might not be obvious to others.
Scenario: A client has a process which consists of a stored procedure that wraps a bunch of other stored procedures. The process runs for about 10 hours.
Taking a look&amp;hellip;what is running right now?</description></item><item><title>dbachecks - Going parallel - Cut off your execution times</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/26/dbachecks-Going-parallel-Cut-off-your-execution-times/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2018/04/26/dbachecks-Going-parallel-Cut-off-your-execution-times/</guid><description>On one of the last clients I have worked, I have implemented dbachecks in order to get the state of art and know how cool or bad the environments are before start knocking down the bad practices.
This client has seven different environments with more than 100 instances and more than 2000 databases.
Serial execution A non-parallel execution (single session) took more than 2 hours. This is not a big problem when we run it out of hours and we don&amp;rsquo;t want/need to be looking or waiting for it to finish.</description></item><item><title>New version of sp_WhoIsActive (v11.20) is available - Deployed on 123 instances in less than 1 minute</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/12/05/New-version-of-sp_WhoIsActive-v11.20-is-available-Deployed-on-123-instances-in-less-than-1-minute/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/12/05/New-version-of-sp_WhoIsActive-v11.20-is-available-Deployed-on-123-instances-in-less-than-1-minute/</guid><description>Last night, I received Adam Machanic&amp;rsquo;s (b | t) newsletter &amp;ldquo;Announcing sp_whoisactive v11.20: Live Query Plans&amp;rdquo;.
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know about it, sp_WhoIsActive is a stored procedure that provides detailed information about the sessions running on your SQL Server instance. It is a great tool when we need to troubleshoot some problems such as long-running queries or blocking. (just two examples)
This stored procedure works on any version/edition since SQL Server 2005 SP1.</description></item></channel></rss>
