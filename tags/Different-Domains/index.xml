The user&amp;rsquo;s password needs to be updated each 40/45 days (it depends on the domain).
Can you see the pain? This means that every month and half I have to dedicate like 20 minutes to change my password on 10 different domains by logging in to a host that belongs to that domain to be able to change it.</description></item><item><title>'Invalid class [0x80041010]' error when trying to access SQLServer's WMI classes</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/07/Invalid-class-0x80041010-error-when-trying-to-access-SQLServers-WMI-classes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/07/Invalid-class-0x80041010-error-when-trying-to-access-SQLServers-WMI-classes/</guid><description>I was using open source PowerShell module dbatools ( GitHub repository ) to get the list of SQL Server services I have on a bunch of hosts so I could confirm if they are in &amp;ldquo;running&amp;rdquo; state.
&amp;ndash; Quick note &amp;ndash; For those who don’t know, dbatools is a module, written by the community, that makes SQL Server administration much easier using PowerShell. Today, the module has more than 260 commands.</description></item><item><title>HTTP 403 error - PowerShell Remoting, Different Domains and Proxies</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/04/HTTP-403-error-PowerShell-Remoting-Different-Domains-and-Proxies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/04/HTTP-403-error-PowerShell-Remoting-Different-Domains-and-Proxies/</guid><description>On my day to day work I use Nagios monitoring software. I want to add some custom SQL Server scripts to enrich the monitoring, and to accomplish this I will need to:
Find a folder Create a sub folder Copy bunch of file edit a ini file to verify/add new entries all of this for every single host on my entire estate. Obviously (for me :-) ) I decided to use PowerShell!</description></item></channel></rss>
