Recently, dbatools added a new command that turns this validation a piece of cake. Thanks to Simone Bizzotto (@niphlod) for baking up the command that Shawn Melton (@wsmelton) and I initially requested.
Some dbatools users already expressed their happiness with the command, like Jess Pomfret did here So, I thought that this information should be shared with other people too.</description></item></channel></rss>
