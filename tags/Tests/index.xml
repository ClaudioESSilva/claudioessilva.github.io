This client has seven different environments with more than 100 instances and more than 2000 databases.

Together “Let’s get all Posh – What are you going to automate today?”
I have written some blog posts on how I use PowerShell to automate mundane tasks or some other more complex scenarios like: Find and fix SQL Server databases with empty owner property using dbatools PowerShell module or Have you backed up your SQL Logins today?</description></item></channel></rss>
