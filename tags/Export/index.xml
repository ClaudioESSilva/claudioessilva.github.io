&lt;p>As one of dbatools&amp;rsquo; first members, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for years and it&amp;rsquo;s really my goto tool. This task was no different!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today&amp;rsquo;s tip and trick using &lt;a href="https://dbatools.io"

 dbatools
&lt;/a>
 is about generating an Excel workbook that contains lists of SQL Server roles and its members.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-usefulness-of-these-reports">The Usefulness of these Reports&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>These reports are especially useful when performing tech-refreshes (migrating from an old version to a newer one) and you want to do some housekeeping. For example, finding logins that should be part of a role and they are not. Once you know there are problems, you decided to do a double-check on the whole list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backup your SQL instances configurations to GIT with dbatools - Part 2 - Add parallelism</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/04/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-2-Add-parallelism/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/04/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-2-Add-parallelism/</guid><description>&lt;p>We have seen how we can export and save the results to a folder and commit them to a GIT repository on my last blog post &lt;a href="https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/02/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-1/"

 Backup your SQL instances configurations to GIT with dbatools – Part 1

At the end of that post, I have mentioned that I would write about how we can lower down the execution times of our script by leveraging on parallelism.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="going-parallel">Going parallel&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we need to manage dozens of servers/instances, even with automated scripts sometimes we would like that our script finishes faster.
There are multiple reasons that a sequential (one-by-one) run takes longer.
Few examples I have hit in the past:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backup your SQL instances configurations to GIT with dbatools - Part 1</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/02/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/06/02/Backup-your-SQL-instances-configurations-to-GIT-with-dbatools-Part-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I want to share how I&amp;rsquo;m keeping a copy of instances&amp;rsquo; configurations using &lt;a href="https://dbatools.io"

In this post, I will add one step and save the output on a GIT repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pre-requirements">Pre-requirements&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You need a GIT repository&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GIT tools installed on the server where you are running the script so you can commit your changes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dbatools&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A list or a place to get all instances that you want to run the export&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="preparation">Preparation&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="git-repository">Git repository&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Clone your repository to a location where dbatools can write to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replicate permissions to new Login/User with dbatools</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/28/Replicate-permissions-to-new-Login/User-with-dbatools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2020/05/28/Replicate-permissions-to-new-Login/User-with-dbatools/</guid><description>&lt;p>Continuing to share tips and tricks using &lt;a href="https://dbatools.io"

 Refresh databases that belongs to availability group using dbatools

 posted a few days ago, today I will share a way to export the permissions of a login/user at instance/database level and apply them to a new login/user.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-typical-request">The typical request&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Client: &amp;ldquo;We have a new colleague, can you please grant them the exact same permissions I have?!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick note/suggestion that may help minimize your work: If we are talking about a Windows Login, please suggest the use of AD groups to help you (so that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to do this process) and also them (they don&amp;rsquo;t need to make this request).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
