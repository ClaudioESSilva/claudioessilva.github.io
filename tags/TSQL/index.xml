To check my progress I needed to check the size before/after the task in an easy way for multiple Azure SQL DBs.
Check Azure SQL DB storage space for 1 database If you need to check the storage space being used by 1 Azure SQL DB, that is as easy as jumping on the portal, select the desired database and you can find the information in the Overview.</description></item><item><title>Using Common Table Expression (CTE) - Did you know...</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/11/30/Using-Common-Table-Expression-CTE-Did-you-know.../</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/11/30/Using-Common-Table-Expression-CTE-Did-you-know.../</guid><description>Today I will write just a short blog post to do a quick reminder!

Maybe they are focusing on the &amp;ldquo;temporary&amp;rdquo; word.
Using the CTE two times will perform two different executions!</description></item></channel></rss>
