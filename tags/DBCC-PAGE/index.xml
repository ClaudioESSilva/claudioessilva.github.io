Short answer: The column is marked as &amp;lsquo;deleted&amp;rsquo; and will stop being visible/usable.
But, most importantly - The record/table size will remain unchanged.
A metadata operation Dropping a column is a metadata/logical operation, not a physical one. This means that the data isn&amp;rsquo;t removed/overwritten by this action. As Paul Randal mentions here :
&amp;ldquo;the cost of that will be deferred for the inserters and not for the deleters&amp;rdquo;.</description></item></channel></rss>
