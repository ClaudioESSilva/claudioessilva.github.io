I immediately thought about dbatools for the job!
NOTE: I also thought about SSMS &amp;ldquo;Import/Export Data&amp;rdquo;. And this is ok when someone says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s to run just once, just now&amp;rdquo;. When you are in the IT for a while you know that is not only once :-). And what if I need to re-run?</description></item><item><title>Scripting SQL Server objects with dbatools - Beyond default options</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/15/Scripting-SQL-Server-objects-with-dbatools-Beyond-default-options/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/15/Scripting-SQL-Server-objects-with-dbatools-Beyond-default-options/</guid><description>Probably you had the need to script out some objects from a SQL Server instance/database and this is quite easy. You just need to right click on the object (well&amp;hellip;not on every single one, try it with an Availability Group :-), no script option available) select &amp;ldquo;Script XXXX as&amp;rdquo; and you have it.
But have you realized that this option doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring all the stuff? Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are scripting a table and you have a Non-Clustered index or a trigger&amp;hellip;using this option some of the objects under the table will not be scripted out.</description></item></channel></rss>
