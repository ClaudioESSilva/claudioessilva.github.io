&lt;p>On the professional level, it can be purely technical like SQL Server installation, configuration or even uninstall, but they can also be not so technical like when a colleague join the team and someone needs to request permissions to access the company&amp;rsquo;s tools (such as ticketing/incidents/VPN/etc).&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="scenario">Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Client wants to analyze most recent deadlocks that happened on a specific instance. They asked us to send the xdl files.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-we-get-the-deadlocks">How do we get the deadlocks?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Depending on the version of SQL Server that you are running, there are different ways to do it.
In this post I will share how you can do it from all files that belongs to the &lt;code>system_health&lt;/code> extended event session. (Not only the current file).
This works on SQL Server 2012 or higher version.
For a better overview I recommend you to read the &lt;a href="https://www.sqlshack.com/what-are-sql-server-deadlocks-and-how-to-monitor-them/"

&lt;p>A non-parallel execution (single session) took more than 2 hours.
This is not a big problem when we run it out of hours and we don&amp;rsquo;t want/need to be looking or waiting for it to finish.
I set up it to run at 6 in the morning and when I arrive at the office I can refresh the Power BI dashboard a get a recent state of art.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Invalid class [0x80041010]' error when trying to access SQLServer's WMI classes</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/07/Invalid-class-0x80041010-error-when-trying-to-access-SQLServers-WMI-classes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2017/09/07/Invalid-class-0x80041010-error-when-trying-to-access-SQLServers-WMI-classes/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was using open source PowerShell module &lt;a href="http://dbatools.io"

&lt;p>&amp;ndash; Quick note &amp;ndash;
For those who don’t know, dbatools is a module, written by the community, that makes SQL Server administration much easier using PowerShell. Today, the module has more than 260 commands. Go get it and try it! If you have any doubt you can join the team on the #dbatools channel at the &lt;a href="http://dbatools.io/slack"

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Find a folder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a sub folder&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copy bunch of file&lt;/li>
&lt;li>edit a ini file to verify/add new entries&lt;/li>
