This blog post aims to make you remember something: something that is obvious to you, might not be obvious to others.
A client has a process which consists of a stored procedure that wraps a bunch of other stored procedures. The process runs for about 10 hours.
I was curious about the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this running before but never explored the code.</description></item><item><title>Allow SQL Server Agent jobs management for non sysadmins</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/08/13/Allow-SQL-Server-Agent-jobs-management-for-non-sysadmins/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/08/13/Allow-SQL-Server-Agent-jobs-management-for-non-sysadmins/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about your experience when it comes to SQL Server Agent jobs but often I receive requests to grant permission so that clients can handle their jobs in an autonomous way.
It depends ðŸ˜„ If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiarized with the difficulty this can bring, let me share with you a different way to accomplish the task without adding the login to the sysadmin instance role. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that on a production instance.</description></item><item><title>'Ups...I have deleted some data. Can you put it back?' - dbatools for the rescue</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/17/Ups...I-have-deleted-some-data.-Can-you-put-it-back-dbatools-for-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/17/Ups...I-have-deleted-some-data.-Can-you-put-it-back-dbatools-for-the-rescue/</guid><description>Few days ago I received a request to restore a dozen of tables because someone have deleted more data than it was supposed. I immediately thought about dbatools for the job!
NOTE: I also thought about SSMS &amp;ldquo;Import/Export Data&amp;rdquo;. And this is ok when someone says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s to run just once, just now&amp;rdquo;. When you are in the IT for a while you know that is not only once :-). And what if I need to re-run?</description></item><item><title>Scripting SQL Server objects with dbatools - Beyond default options</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/15/Scripting-SQL-Server-objects-with-dbatools-Beyond-default-options/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/15/Scripting-SQL-Server-objects-with-dbatools-Beyond-default-options/</guid><description>Probably you had the need to script out some objects from a SQL Server instance/database and this is quite easy. You just need to right click on the object (well&amp;hellip;not on every single one, try it with an Availability Group :-), no script option available) select &amp;ldquo;Script XXXX as&amp;rdquo; and you have it.
But have you realized that this option doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring all the stuff? Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are scripting a table and you have a Non-Clustered index or a trigger&amp;hellip;using this option some of the objects under the table will not be scripted out.</description></item></channel></rss>
