&lt;p>This blog post aims to make you remember something: something that is obvious to you, might not be obvious to others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="scenario">Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A client has a process which consists of a stored procedure that wraps a bunch of other stored procedures.
The process runs for about 10 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="taking-a-lookwhat-is-running-right-now">Taking a look&amp;hellip;what is running right now?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I was curious about the process, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen this running before but never explored the code. After a couple of days of seeing it running for so long, I decided to see what would be the random query I would get executing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Allow SQL Server Agent jobs management for non sysadmins</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/08/13/Allow-SQL-Server-Agent-jobs-management-for-non-sysadmins/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/08/13/Allow-SQL-Server-Agent-jobs-management-for-non-sysadmins/</guid><description>&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know about your experience when it comes to SQL Server Agent jobs but often I receive requests to grant permission so that clients can handle their jobs in an autonomous way.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It depends üòÑ
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiarized with the difficulty this can bring, let me share with you a different way to accomplish the task without adding the login to the sysadmin instance role. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that on a production instance.
The next possible way is to make the login as the owner of the job and it needs to belong to one of the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/sql-server-agent-fixed-database-roles?view=sql-server-2017"

 msdb fixed database roles
&lt;/a>
! You can take a look at this documentation and see the matrix there for each role.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>'Ups...I have deleted some data. Can you put it back?' - dbatools for the rescue</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/17/Ups...I-have-deleted-some-data.-Can-you-put-it-back-dbatools-for-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/17/Ups...I-have-deleted-some-data.-Can-you-put-it-back-dbatools-for-the-rescue/</guid><description>&lt;p>Few days ago I received a request to restore a dozen of tables because someone have deleted more data than it was supposed.
I immediately thought about &lt;a href="https://dbatools.io"

 dbatools
&lt;/a>
 for the job!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NOTE: I also thought about SSMS &amp;ldquo;Import/Export Data&amp;rdquo;. And this is ok when someone says &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s to run just once, just now&amp;rdquo;. When you are in the IT for a while you know that is not only once :-). And what if I need to re-run? Or save it as example and share with my colleagues? Doing this using a PowerShell script makes it much more flexible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scripting SQL Server objects with dbatools - Beyond default options</title><link>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/15/Scripting-SQL-Server-objects-with-dbatools-Beyond-default-options/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://claudioessilva.eu/2019/05/15/Scripting-SQL-Server-objects-with-dbatools-Beyond-default-options/</guid><description>&lt;p>Probably you had the need to script out some objects from a SQL Server instance/database and this is quite easy. You just need to right click on the object (well&amp;hellip;not on every single one, try it with an Availability Group :-), no script option available) select &amp;ldquo;Script XXXX as&amp;rdquo; and you have it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But have you realized that this option doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring all the stuff?
Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are scripting a table and you have a Non-Clustered index or a trigger&amp;hellip;using this option some of the objects under the table will not be scripted out. I understand this as each one of this is a different object, which means if you go to each one you can right click and script just that one.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
