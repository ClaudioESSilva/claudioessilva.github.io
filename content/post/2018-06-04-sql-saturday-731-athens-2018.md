In less than two weeks (on 16th June) it's time for <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/731/EventHome.aspx">SQL Saturday Athens</a> and I'm proud to announce that I will be speaking!

This will be my first SQL Saturday ever both as speaker and attendee outside Portugal so I'm especially thrilled and excited to be part of it!

I will be presenting my <a href="http://www.sqlsaturday.com/731/Sessions/Details.aspx?sid=71728">Administrate SSRS/PBIRS with PowerShell</a> session and I can share in first hand that it will include new demos with some fixes and enhancements that will be available on the next version of the module later this week.

The event will be held at [here](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/731/Sessions/Schedule.aspx).

Hope to see you in Athens! If you see me, come and say hi!
