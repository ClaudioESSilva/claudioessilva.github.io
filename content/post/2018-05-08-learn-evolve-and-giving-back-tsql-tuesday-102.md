This month’s T-SQL Tuesday is brought to us by Riley Major‏ ([b](https://scribnasium.com) \| [t](https://twitter.com/RileyMajor)) and he encourage us to talk about how we are helping by giving back to our community.

This is the 102nd edition of [TSQL2sDay](http://tsqltuesday.com/) - an Adam Machanic’s ([b](http://dataeducation.com/blog/) \| [t](https://twitter.com/AdamMachanic)) brainchild.

## Let's go back for a moment:

I have heard about SQL Server the first time back in 2003 when I was on the high school and I had a database class. Was a slow start and, at that moment I haven't imagined that would follow that path professionally.

### Learn

At that time I didn't even know that a community exists, but when I went to professional course (level IV - it's a degree before bachelors) on 2006 that was based on Microsoft technologies, .NET (Web and Windows forms) and I had a database class using SQL Server 2000!
That was when I started using more and more the internet for study, found some blogs posts and the [SQLServerCentral](http://www.sqlservercentral.com/). So I can say that I started consuming the knowledge from the community back on 2006.

A year later I started my intership in what was my first IT job. At the time I needed to work with a bit of everything but more focused on SQL Server development. The guy that was on my place before I arrived took a manager position but he was a big lover of SQL Server and I learnt a LOT from him! At the time he subscribed the [SQLServer Magazine](http://www.itprotoday.com/sql-server-pro-digital-magazine-archives) in paper! (later the name changed for SQLServer Pro).

You can found the maganize archives in PDF format [here](http://www.itprotoday.com/sql-server-pro-digital-magazine-archives).

That was when I start knewing who people like [Itzik Ben-Gan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sqlqueen">Kalen Delaney](https://twitter.com/ItzikBenGan) were!

### Evolve

During about five years I was a compulsive consumer of blog posts related with SQL Server development but most of the time was when I had a problem and wanted some guidance on the solution. During that time I haven't shared too much knowledge on the internet.

Then, 2012, I went to my first SQL Port user group meetings and my first ever SQL Saturday, [115 Portugal](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/115/eventhome.aspx). Those were my first real contact with SQL Server community and where I met some speakers and started to join the montly meetings regulary.

### Giving back

At 2015 I joined [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClaudioESSilva) and decided that I wanted to share my knowledge even more. So after being approached several times I took courage and did my first public presentation for [SQL Port](http://sqlport.com) user group in Lisbon and right after I submitted a session for [SQL Saturday Oporto 2015](http://www.sqlsaturday.com/429/eventhome.aspx) and I was accepted.
You know, start small and grow...so I started talking in Portuguese for the user group and then went to SQL Saturday where I did the first public speech in English.

Now, we were in 2016 and was the first edition of [TugaIT](http://tugait.pt/) (the [CFS is open for this year - Summer Edition](https://sessionize.com/tuga-it-2018/)) and at that time I was "just" a volunteer but I had a gut feeling - I have discovered, few months earlier, that dbatools was a thing and decided to go and talk with the creator [Chrissy LeMaire](https://twitter.com/cl) - I had written a couple of PowerShell scripts to help me and decided to ask her if she has the intention to extend the module to best practices and we talk for like 1 hour, exchange contacts and started talking furiously about dbatools and then...I was doing a PR with a full command ([Expand-DbaTLogResponsibly](https://dbatools.io/functions/expand-dbatlogresponsibly/)) and this was the time I felt I was doing my first "more international" contribution to the community.

Since then I have being more active on the community mainly with SQLServer and PowerShell stuff.

Some contribution points:

<ul>
<li>Help organizing and also as volunteer on several user group meetings, SQL Saturday (Lisbon), [TugaIT](http://tugait.pt/) and also co-lead the [Global Virtual Group Portuguese](http://globalportuguese.pass.org/).</li>
<li>Speaking on local user groups, Virtual Groups, national SQL Saturdays (Lisbon, Oporto) and international conferences like [SQLGrillen](https://sqlgrillen.de/), [SQLBits](https://sqlbits.com/)</li>
<li>Contribution with multiple commands, improvements and fixes for some tools like [dbatools](https://dbatools.io), [dbachecks](https://dbachecks.io) and Microsoft's [ReportingServicesTools](https://github.com/Microsoft/ReportingServicesTools/)</li>
<li>Started this blog on September 2017 to write down some notes and, again, share with others.</li>
<li>Active on social media like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ClaudioESSilva) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudioessilva)</li>
</ul>

## What you will do?

As you can see I didn't born inside the comunity, I have grown because of it and decided to start giving back less then 3 years ago.
It hurst? Nothing!
It helps? A lot!
Help me be a better professional? For sure, I have learned so much from many different sources and every day is a new learning day!

Thanks for reading.
